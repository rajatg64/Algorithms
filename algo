Asymptotic Analysis:we evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size (we donâ€™t measure the actual running time). 
		    We calculate, how does the time (or space) taken by an algorithm increases with the input size.
limitation of Asymptotic Analysis:
	1-two algo takes 100nlogn and 2nlogn time.Both of these algorithms are asymptotically same (order of growth is nLogn).so we can't judge which is better.
	2-we always talk about input sizes larger than a constant value. It might be possible that those large inputs are never given to your software

1) T Notation-both upper bound and lower bound
2) Big O Notation- upper bound
3) O Notation-lower bound


Linear Search O(n)
Binary Search (works on sorted array) O(Log(n))
Jump Search :Binary Search is better than Jump Search, but Jump search has an advantage that we traverse back only once (Binary Search may require up to O(Log n) jumps,
 		consider a situation where the element to be search is the smallest element or smaller than the smallest).
		 So in a systems where jumping back is costly, we use Jump Search. O(sqrt(n))
